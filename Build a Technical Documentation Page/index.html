          Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
          Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy 
          emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its 
          language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
          logical code for small and large-scale projects.
